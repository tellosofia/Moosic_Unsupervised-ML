# Moosic_Unsupervised-ML
Explore Moosic's journey to automate playlist creation using Data Science. Leveraging Spotify API data, this project uses K-Means clustering to group songs by audio features like tempo and energy. Assess the effectiveness of these features in capturing a song's "mood" and the viability of clustering for playlist creation.
